## About the Project

This tool is a game wrapper on top of the [Unity Project Patcher](https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher).

This takes a build of R.E.P.O., extracts its assets/scripts/etc, and then generates a project for usage in the Unity editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool does not distribute game files. It simply works off of your copy of the game!
>
> Also, this tool is for **personal** use only. Do not re-distrubute game files to others.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following before using the tool in any way:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
  - To run Asset Ripper

## Installation

### Unity Project

- Requires [Unity 2022.3.21](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.21)
- Unity built-in render pipeline

Create a new Unity project with the above requirements before getting started.

You will need to install three packages in sequence here:

- Unity Project Patcher: `https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher.git`
- Unity Project Patcher BepInEx: `https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher-bepinex.git`
  - [Can be disabled](#disabling-bepinex-usage)
- This project

### Installing the Unity Project Patcher core

1. Open the Package Manager from `Window > Package Manager`
2. Click the '+' button in the top-left of the window
3. Click 'Add package from git URL'
4. Provide the URL of the this git repository: `https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher.git`
   - If you are using a specific version, you can append it to the end of the git URL, such as `#v1.2.3`
5. Click the 'add' button

```json
"com.nomnom.unity-project-patcher": "https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher.git"
```

- If you are using a specific version, you can append it to the end of the git URL, such as `#v1.2.3`

### Installing this Game Wrapper

The same steps as previously, just with `https://github.com/therealkoba/unity-repo-project-patcher.git`

### Installing the BepInEx Wrapper

Open the tool window `Tools > Unity Project Patcher > Open Window` and press the `Install BepInEx` button.

Otherwise, follow the steps at https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher-bepinex

#### Disabling BepInEx Usage

If you don't want to use plugins, then follow the steps at https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher-bepinex#disabling-this-package

## Usage

The tool window can be opened via `Tools > Unity Project Patcher > Open Window`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool mostly supports patching an already patched project, although this can lead to broken assets.
> So make sure you back up your project beforehand.

Estimated patch durations:

- Fresh patch: ~10 min
- Already patched: TBD

These can vary wildly depending on system speed and project size.
